Course Delivery Mode
The course uses various instructional methods, such as lectures, demonstrations, hands-on
exercises, and take-home assignments. The delivery mode depends on whether the course is
online or in person. Online lectures will be the primary mode, but there may be in-person
lectures for in-person participants. Labs will be conducted virtually for the online program, while
in-person program students must attend on-campus labs. For more information about the delivery
mode, please refer to D2L. Any updates will be communicated through D2L in advance.
