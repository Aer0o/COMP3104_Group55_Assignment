Course Delivery Mode
The course uses various instructional methods, such as lectures, demonstrations, hands-on
exercises, and take-home assignments. The delivery mode depends on whether the course is

lectures for in-person participants. Labs will be conducted virtually for the online program, while
in-person program students must attend on-campus labs. For more information about the delivery

Assignment Policy
● All assignments must be submitted on the due date based on an instruction given by the
professor. Late assignment will be penalized 20% per day to a maximum of seven days,
the weekend included unless the student has notified the professor (via email, phone or in
person) ahead of the due date that he/she has a valid reason for a late submission.
Test Policy
● Students must complete tests and the final exam on the assigned day. If unable to
complete the test/exam as scheduled, students are required to notify the professor at least
three days prior to the date, so alternative arrangements can be made. Failure to comply
with this policy may result in a zero grade.
● There will be no makeup quiz and lab exercises. If you anticipate missing more than two
quizzes or lab exercises for serious, major reasons, notify your professor beforehand.

may include failing the assignment or the course or more severe disciplinary actions. Students
must also download the AI Usage Declaration form from D2L, complete it, and submit it
with their assignments where AI use is permitted. Adherence to these guidelines is mandatory
