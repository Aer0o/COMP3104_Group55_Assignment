DevOps is a modern software development approach that aims to dismantle silos and foster cooperation between teams, 
motivating them to work closely during the entire software development process.

DevOps promotes automation and enables the team to focus on more essential tasks like developing new features, enhancing the user experience, 
and fixing issues leading to streamlined, efficient, expedited software development.

For instance, let’s say you’re working on a project to develop a new e-commerce platform. Traditionally, 
the development team would work on coding the software, while the cloud operations team would focus on deploying and maintaining the software on servers. However, with DevOps, these two teams work together from the start of the project to the end.

The development team will create the code, while the cloud operations team will focus on setting up the servers and creating a deployment pipeline. 
By working together, they can identify any issues early on and address them before the product’s final release.

In essence, employing DevOps in the development process will promote collaboration, automation, and continuous improvement, 
enabling you to deliver a high-quality e-commerce platform more efficiently.
